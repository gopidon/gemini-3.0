            "2.  **Redundant Key Storage:** You are creating 1,000,000 distinct dictionaries. While Python creates internal references for the key strings (\"timestamp\", etc.), the *structure* holding those keys is recreated 1 million times.\n",
            "3.  **Object Header Overhead:** A standard Python dictionary object is quite large (typically 240+ bytes even when empty or small). Multiplied by 1 million, that is ~240MB of overhead before you even put data in.\n",

            "\n",
            "The current implementation uses a standard Python `dict` for every single record. While dictionaries are highly optimized for lookup speed (O(1)), they are extremely memory-inefficient for storing large arrays of structured data due to the following overheads:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Hash Table Overhead:** Every dictionary maintains a sparse hash table to manage keys. To prevent collisions, this table is always larger than the number of items it contains (usually 33-50% empty space).\n",
            "2.  **Per-Object Overhead:** Every Python object (`int`, `str`, `float`) carries a PyObject header (reference count, type pointer) which adds 24-48 bytes *per value*, on top of the raw data.\n",
            "3.  **String Interning & Pointers:** While Python interns some small strings, creating 1 million unique dictionaries means creating millions of pointers to string keys (`timestamp`, `sensor_id`, etc.).\n",
            "4.  **Redundancy:** The keys `'timestamp'`, `'sensor_id'`, etc., are repeated 1,000,000 times in memory structures, even though the schema is identical for every record.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Rough Math:** A single dictionary of this size consumes roughly 240-400 bytes in overhead + pointers. 1 million of them easily reaches the gigabyte range when combined with the list structure and object headers.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Thinking Process: Exploring Architectures\n",
            "\n",
            "To solve this, we need to remove the per-record schema overhead. Here are three approaches:\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Option A: `namedtuple`\n",
            "*   **Pros:** Immutable (safer), lightweight compared to dicts, accessible via dot notation (`record.voltage`).\n",
            "*   **Cons:** Still separate Python objects. Still incurs PyObject header overhead for every instance.\n",
            "*   **Memory Savings:** Moderate (~40-50%). Likely not enough to hit the 70% reduction target reliably if the strings are large.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Option B: Pandas / NumPy\n",
            "*   **Pros:** Massive memory reduction. Data is stored in contiguous C-arrays (like C structs). `int64` takes exactly 8 bytes, not 28 bytes like a Python int.\n",
            "*   **Cons:** External dependency (not standard library). While fast for vectorized operations, iterating row-by-row (if the downstream code requires it) is actually *slower* than native Python.\n",
            "*   **Verdict:** Excellent for analysis, but if this is a data processing pipeline needing standard library compatibility, it might be overkill.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Option C: Class with `__slots__`\n",
            "*   **Pros:** Standard library. Tells Python \"Do not create a `__dict__` for this object.\" It statically allocates memory only for the specific attributes defined.\n",
            "*   **Cons:** Objects are mutable (can be a pro or con). Cannot add new attributes at runtime.\n",
            "*   **Memory Savings:** Massive. Removes the dictionary overhead entirely. We only pay for the object header and the pointers to the values.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Option D: `struct` packing (The \"Nuclear Option\")\n",
            "*   **Pros:** Stores data as raw bytes. Zero object overhead.\n",
            "*   **Cons:** Access speed is slow because you have to \"unpack\" data every time you read it. Complex to read/write.\n",
            "*   **Verdict:** Too complex for general use, tradeoffs on speed are too high.\n",
